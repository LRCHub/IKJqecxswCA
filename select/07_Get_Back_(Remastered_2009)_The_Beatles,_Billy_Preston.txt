Jojo was a man
Who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass

Get back
Get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back
Get back
Get back to where you once belonged

Get back Jojo

Go home
Get back
Get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back
Get back
Get back to where you once belonged

Get back, Jo

Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say she's got it coming
But she gets it while she can

Get back
Get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back
Get back
Get back to where you once belonged

Get back, Loretta

Go home
Oh, get back
Get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back
Get back
Get back to where you once belonged

Get back Loretta
Your mommy's waiting for you
Wearing her high heel shoes
And a low neck sweater
Get back home, Loretta

Get back
Get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back
Get back
Get back, oh yeah
