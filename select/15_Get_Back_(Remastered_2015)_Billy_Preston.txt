Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back Jo Jo

Jo Jo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it wouldn't last
Jo Jo left his home in Tuscon, Arizona
For some California grass

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged

Sweet Loretta Modern thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around said she's got it comin'
But she gets it while she can

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged

Get back Loretta
Your momma's waiting for you
With her high heel shoes
And her low neck sweater
Get back Loretta

Get back, get on back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get on back
Get back to where you once belonged
